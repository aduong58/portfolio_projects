In this data analysis project, I examined key metrics within sales data to draw out insights on the overall performance of Elist and provide data-driven recommendations.

The main metrics I focused on were sales revenue, average order value (AOV), and order counts. I worked with these metrics to analyze and break down overall sales trends, product performance, effectiveness of their loyalty program, as well as other relevant areas of the business. <br><br>

**Overall Sales Trends**
Total Sales                |  AOV and Orders           | Sales by Month

In 2019, the initial year of sales records, Elist generated $3.26 million in sales. In the following year, the company observed a significant growth in revenue, generating $8.62 million in sales for 2020, more than doubling the revenue of the previous year's sales.

Analyzing the quarterly breakdown of revenue data reveals a peak in Q4 of 2020, where sales generated $2.5 million for just that quarter. Following this period of substantial growth, there has been a gradual decrease in revenue generated from sales. <br><br>

**Product Performance**

Looking at the order count of products sold by Elist, the top performing product is Apple Airpods Headphones, making up nearly 45% of all orders made. On the other hand, the worst performing product sold was the Bose Soundsport Headphones, making up less than .03% of all orders made through Elist.

Another product of interest is the 4k Gaming Monitor. It is the second most popular product sold by Elist, making 22% of orders made. However, it has generated the most revenue of all products at $8.4M, making up 35% of the total revenue generated from sales. <br><br>

**Loyalty Program**

In the early years of the loyalty program, the program was not performing as well as the orders made by regular customers. However, in more recent years, sales generated from members of the loyalty program have begun to outpace that of regular customers in various sales metrics.

In 2021 and beyond, members of the loyalty program have placed 16% more orders and generated over $1M more in revenue than non-loyalty customers. In addition to this, in 2022, loyalty members spent more money per order with an AOV of $246 compared to the AOV of regular customers at $212.
