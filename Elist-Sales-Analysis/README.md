# Project - Elist Sales Analysis
Founded in 2018, Elist is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products and has since expanded to a global customer base. 

In this data analysis project, I examined key metrics within sales data to draw out insights on the overall performance of Elist and provide data-driven recommendations in the areas of sales, product, marketing, and operations.

The main metrics I focused on were sales revenue, average order value (AOV), and order counts. I worked with these metrics to analyze and break down overall sales trends, product performance, effectiveness of their loyalty program, as well as other relevant areas of the business. <br>

# About the data
The company maintains a core dataset consisting of orders, order statuses, customers, products, and geographic information. 

Documentation on the cleaning and preparation of the data can be found **here**

The workbook containing the original dataset and created tables can be found **here**


# Technical Analysis
The analysis portion of this project was done within Excel. To summarize insights and segment the data into different categories, I chose to use pivot tables alongside conditional formatting. Throughout the project I utilized aggregation functions to clean the data and calculate new fields.

In 2019, the initial year of sales records, Elist generated $3.26 million in sales. In the following year, the company observed a significant growth in revenue, generating $8.62 million in sales for 2020, more than doubling the revenue of the previous year's sales.

Analyzing the quarterly breakdown of revenue data reveals a peak in Q4 of 2020, where sales generated $2.5 million for just that quarter. Following this period of substantial growth, there has been a gradual decrease in revenue generated from sales. <br><br>


**Product Performance**

Looking at the order count of products sold by Elist, the top performing product is Apple Airpods Headphones, making up nearly 45% of all orders made. On the other hand, the worst performing product sold was the Bose Soundsport Headphones, making up just .03% of all orders made through Elist.

Another product of interest is the 4k Gaming Monitor. It is the second most popular product sold by Elist, making up 22% of orders made. However, it has generated the most revenue of all products at $8.4M, making up 35% of the total revenue generated from sales. <br><br>

Quarters are highlighted where sales, AOV, and order count perform better in either group (Loyalty vs. Non-Loyalty) |  

In the early years of the loyalty program, the program was not performing as well as the orders made by regular customers. However, in more recent years, sales generated from members of the loyalty program have begun to outpace that of regular customers in various sales metrics.

In 2021 and beyond, members of the loyalty program placed 16% more orders and generated over $1M more in revenue than non-loyalty customers. In addition to this, in 2022, loyalty members spent more money per order with an AOV of $246 compared to the AOV of regular customers at $212. <br><br>

The main purchase platform for orders continues to be our desktop website. However, in more recent years (2021 and 2022), there has been a significant growth in orders made through the mobile app.


# Recommendations

**Overall Sales Trends**
- Sales are plummeting, we should work on identifying our core customer base and focusing efforts to retain that customer base.

**Product Performance**
- I would recommend considering streamlining product offerings and investing more in products that bring in the most orders and profit. With more data on product costs we could better understand the profitablity and overall performance of each product.

**Loyalty Program**
- Seeing the growth and performance of Elist's loyalty program within the recent years of sales, I would recommend keeping the loyalty program and looking closer at what is drawing customers to the program.
- Things I would consider are the awareness/marketing of the loyalty program, associated incentives and rewards of being a member, and alignment of the loyalty program with Elist's overall business goals.

**Purchase Platform and Marketing Channels**
- In more recent years the mobile site has been growing as a purchase platform, I would recommend reviewing the mobile site operations to maintain and possibly expand ease of usability.
