Hello! Currently a work in progress, transferring information over from BigQuery and Tableau Desktop.

This is a complementary portion to the [Nexus Sales Analysis](https://github.com/aduong58/portfolio_projects/tree/main/Nexus-Sales-Analysis) project. This subsegment of the main project will contain:
1. SQL queries that were used for ad-hoc analysis before and during the Excel analysis.
2. Tableau dashboard created towards the end of the project for more visual analysis of the data.
